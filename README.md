# NameCreator
Create completely random names based on human linguistic patterns. Suitable for name generation on projects, finding unique names, or just entertainment

> **NOTE:** Due to the randomness process in name generation, there is a small chance that some generated names may contain inappropriate words. This is highly unlikely, but please be aware if you're using this in contexts that require strict word filters.

## Features
- Generate random names with no parameters (Default length = 5).
- Customize name length based on user input.
- Names follow natural linguistic patterns to sound more human-like.

## Installation

```bash
